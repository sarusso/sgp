# sgp
Simple Graphs Project, resumed form early 2000.

## Notes

This is a early relase. It should work but the code is not good and this readme is very poor.
Requirements: php and crontab plus common unix commands.
The grapsh will not be shown correctly untill the time period (default 12 hours) is complete.
Please send bugs/notes/suggestiong/greetings to stefano.russo@gmail.com
Thankyou for testing!
